# QR code 4 wifi

Available at: [qrcode4wifi.clemg.fr/](qrcode4wifi.clemg.fr/)

Generate QR codes according to your wifi settings to ease you guests' life. Print the code and stick it on the fridge, the door or keep on your desk. When a guest wants to get access to the wifi, let him scan the code to connect him automatically.

Note: Nothing is ever transmitted to the server. Typing your network's SSID & password does not represent any risk.
